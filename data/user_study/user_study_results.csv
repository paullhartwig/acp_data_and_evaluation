When I tried to ask for different approaches for one case where I thought that the AIs approach was not good, it showed in its thought process that it should give me some information why its way is the best, but then didnt explained anything and just pushed its recommendet change;

Something irritating that it did was assume that I wanted to test the CI with a simple python http server instead of an angular app even though I explicitly mentioned it in the prompt. I often had the feeling that I was as the whims of the AI and that the only way I could improve the output code is to pass back the error messages, which made me feel helpless (especially when it still didn't work after that).
