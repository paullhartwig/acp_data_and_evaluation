# ACP Data and Evaluation

This repository contains the results and data collected for a scientific paper on platform engineering. It includes:

- **User study results:** Data and logs from participants who interacted with AI-assisted development tools as part of the study.
  The test participants were instructed to use vibe coding to create scaffolding for a software system and a complete CI/CD pipeline.
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) benchmark test results:** Evaluation data for a tool developed in this research project to improve the software creation process. The tool combines an agentic manager with retrieval-augmented generation, implemented in Backstage, to automatically select the most suitable template for a desired software product.

The repository is intended to support transparency, reproducibility, and further research in the field of platform engineering and AI-assisted software development.
