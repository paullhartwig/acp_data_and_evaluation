# ACP Data and Evaluation

This repository contains the results and data collected for a scientific paper on platform engineering. It includes:

- **User study results:** Data and logs from participants who interacted with AI-assisted development tools as part of the study.
  The test participants were instructed to use vibe coding to create scaffolding for a software system and a complete CI/CD pipeline.
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) benchmark test results:** Evaluation data and metrics for benchmarking RAG systems in the context of platform engineering.

The repository is intended to support transparency, reproducibility, and further research in the field of platform engineering and AI-assisted software development.
